<h2>How to use the Page context</h2>

<p>
A PageContext is responsible for holding model data that is used by components to perform their rendering.
Each HtmlCanvas has one PageContext. It has an API to set and get values based on a String key.
</p>

<pre class="brush: java">
canvas.getPageContext()
    .withString("title", "Welcome")
    .withInteger("number", 42);
canvas.getPageContext().getInteger("number");
canvas.getPageContext().getString("title", "No Title"); // default value if absent
</pre>

<p>
Values stored in a PageContext are only visible to the component that stored them 
and all nested components that are going to be rendered. 
This allows for a safer way to pass on parameters from top to bottom in the component rendering hierarchy.
Components with a deeper nesting level can only read values from higher levels ; never change them.
</p>

<pre class="brush: java">
public class AccountsListUI implements Renderable {

	public void renderOn(HtmlCanvas html) throws IOException {
		
		List&lt;Account&gt; accounts = (List&lt;Account&gt;)html.getPageContext().getObject("accounts");
		for (Account each : accounts) {
			this.renderAccountOn(each,html);
		}
	}
}
</pre>

<p>
A PageContext is just a variable container with a Map interface.
There is no way to ensure that a variable exists or is of the correct type.
A component may need to perform null checks and, for non-primitive types, perform a Class casting.

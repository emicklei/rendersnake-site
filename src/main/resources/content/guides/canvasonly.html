<h2>Test components with JUnit</h2>

<p>
You can create a HtmlCanvas without a HttpRequest or HttpResponse.
The rendering of a component or page will happen on an internal PrettyWriter that procudes a more readable, indented HTML format.
This enables you to write unit tests for each component. 
Validation of the output is partly done by HtmlCanvas because it verifies that all opened tags are closed in the right order.
If you need more validation (W3C) then you can use jTidy (see below).
</p>

<pre class="brush: java">
public void testPersonalPage() throws IOException {
    HtmlCanvas html = new HtmlCanvas(new PrettyWriter());
    
    // prepare your component and render it
    // the canvas will preform a runtime structure validation (did you close all the tags?)    
    html.render(new ProductDetails());
    
    // simply dump the result
	System.out.println(html.toHtml());        
}
</pre>

<h2>How to include static content</h2>

<p>
Sometimes, it is more convenient to store and maintain larger fixed texts in separate files. 
To include its contents in e.g. a paragraph, you can use the StringResource component. 
On default, the text content is cached in memory (static field of the class). 
</p>

Either use it directly:
<pre class="brush: java">
html.write(StringResource.get("/content/cms.html"),NO_ESCAPE);
html.write(StringResource.get("/js/myfunctions.js"),NO_ESCAPE);
</pre>

or use as a Renderable component: 
<pre class="brush: java">
html.render(new StringResource("/content/cms.html",NO_ESCAPE));
html.render(new StringResource("/content/plain.txt",NO_ESCAPE));
</pre>
NO_ESCAPE is a boolean constant of HtmlCanvas with value "false".<p/>
The contents from the file (such as cms.html from the example) is cached by the StringResource class and is typically stored in /src/main/resources

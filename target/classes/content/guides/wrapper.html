<h2>How to decorate components</h2>

<p>
If your HTML design contains sections that have a similar layout or styling
then you can decide to create a decorating component to capture that common look.
The typical example is a website having a common layout across the pages containing a header, menubar, searchbar, main and footer.
The page itself and each of these sections may be implemented by applying the Decorator or Wrapper design pattern.
</p>

<p>
To create a Wrapper component you must extend <strong>RenderableWrapper</strong> and implement the <strong>renderOn</strong> method.
In this method you write the common elements that should appear before the decorated component is rendered. 
After calling <strong>render(this.component)</strong> you write the common element that should appear <strong>after</strong> the component is rendered.

<pre class="brush: java">
public class SingleTableCellWrapper extends RenderableWrapper {
   
    public SingleTableCellWrapper(Renderable component){
        super(component);
    }
    
    public void renderOn(HtmlCanvas html) throws IOException {
        
        html
          .table()
            .tr()
              .td().render(this.component)._td()
            ._tr()
          ._table();        
    }
}

<h2>How to use the HtmlCanvas</h2>

<p>
HtmlCanvas provides the interface to write HTML elements as part of response to a Web request.
Its interface consists of methods that allow you build a HTML page. For example, to write a hyperlink you write:
</p>

<pre class="brush: java">
html.a(href("otherpage.html")).content("Other Page")

&lt;a href="otherpage.html"&gt;Other Page&lt;/a&gt;
</pre>

<p>
Methods that start with "_" will write the closing tag. HtmlCanvas will verify that you are closing the expected tag.
Each method will return the HtmlCanvas object. 
This allows for a fluent programming style (also known as the Builder coding pattern).
Note that format of the source in this example is chosen to be similar to a well-formed HTML page. 
This is of course not required but is may help to improve readability. 
</p>

<p>
If your component class implements the Renderable interface 
then it will have the <strong>renderOn</strong> method that has a HtmlCanvas as its argument.
A servlet is responsible for creating a HtmlCanvas and calling the renderOn method of your component.
You can use any framework that can dispatch incoming requests to components (see "How to integrate with Web frameworks").

<h2>How to write attributes</h2>

<p>
HtmlAttributes provides the interface to write the HTML attributes for elements.
Its interface consists of methods that allow you define the attributes. 
For example, to write a div with an id and class you write:
</p>

<pre class="brush: java">
html.div(id("me").class_("hidden")).content("Invisible text");

&lt;div id="me" class="hidden"&gt;Invisible text&lt;/a&gt;
</pre>

<p>
In order to make the attribute methods visible to your component class, you must include a static import:
</p>
<pre class="brush: java">
import static org.rendersnake.HtmlAttributesFactory.*
</pre>

<p>
Each method will return the HtmlAttributes object. 
This allows for a fluent programming style (also known as the Builder coding pattern).
Note that the HtmlAttributes object does not check for duplicate attributes.
If the attribute name is acutally a Java reserved word, its corresponding method will have the underscore "_" suffix.
</p>

<p>
The library also includes the JQueryAttributesFactory and JQueryAttributes classes.
These classes has methods for common JQuery(Mobile) attributes.
</p>
<pre class="brush: java">
import static org.rendersnake.ext.jquery.JQueryAttributesFactory.*
</pre>

<p>
If you cannot find the method in either class HtmlAttributes or JQueryAttributes then you can use the generic method.
</p>
<pre class="brush: java">
new HtmlAttributes("key","value").add("another-key","another-value");
</pre>
